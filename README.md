A few demonstrations of code that I have written for classes and other personal projects. Please see the individual descriptions below. 

## MineSweeper-ish
Under the MineSweeper-ish directory, you will find the code for a MineSweeper-like game that I coded up for my Java GUIs class. The source code is located under the src directory.

## SchedulingSimulator
Under the SchedulingSimulator directory, you will find the code for a C++ program that simulates a CPU scheduling tasks. The program was written as an assignment for my Operating Systems class. The simulated CPU can do a variety of scheduling algorithms such as FIFO, Round Robin, Most Recently Used, etc.

## CRUD
Under the CRUD directory, you will find the code I wrote for my Web Development class. It creates a webpage that allows for basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations while featuring persistent data written in JavaScript using nodejs and MySQL. Other languages used to create the webpage include CSS and HTML.
